## A halloween treat 

Use up a pumpkin with a warming fruity rasam. (You can do this with any kind of squash, or even substitute the squash for something like a pear.)

## Ingredients
 - pumpkin - any is ok but recommend a white "ghost" pumpkin. The flesh should be soft and orange, and smell kind of melon-ey.
 - yellow split peas (could also use red lentils)
 - onion
 - garlic
 - tamarind
 - salt and pepper
 - water
   ## spices
   - cumin
   - coriander (leaf and seed)
   - fenugreek
   - fennel
   - mustard seed
   - bay leaf
   - dried chilli

## Methods

  ## Carve your pumpkin (if using a whole pumpkin from scratch)
  - Wash and carve up your pumpkin. It is ok to leave the skin on if it is clean.
  - Rinse the seeds out of the guts of your pumpkin and set aside - roasting with a bit of oil, salt and paprika makes a delicious snack.
  - Discard the fibrous, stringy guts
   
  ## Temper spices (only if they are not ground)
  - In a little bit of hot oil, add in your unground seedy spices and your dried chilli. Saut√© on a high heat until they smell aromatic and begin to jump about.
   
  ## Roast pumpkin
  - Roast your pumpkin chunks in an oven with oil, salt, pepper. If you have kept the skin, set aside some bits with nice rind for toppings.
   
  ## Prepare rasam!
  - Cook onions and garlic in a little oil until transclucent
  - Add your split peas, tomato and all spices
  - Rinse your tomato can out for extra water
  - cook on medium heat for about 20 minutes, strirring consistently.
  - Add chunks of roasted pumpkin and tamarind paste.
  - Cook for a further 10 minutes. While cooking, season with salt as required.
  - Split peas should be soft when it is time to serve. Adjust timings/water until the consistency looks nice.
  
  ## To serve
  - Top with coriander leaf and any nice bits of roast pumpkin rind.
